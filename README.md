Architecture:
* one source file, one webview. 

Differences to VS Code extensions
* a single file of source code - no compilation, not packaging
* distribution via git repo - no publishing, no marketplace
* instant devloop in same IDE - no host IDE
* extension life-cycle equals focus on web view - no install, no uninstall.
